If you want to create a requirements.txt file (with pip freeze --local), Options 1, 2 and 2b won't reflect in requirements.txt that the software should be installed from GitHub. Instead, it will be downloaded from PyPi, which may contain an older version. Thus, if you want to include in requirements.txt that the software should be installed from GitHub, use Option 3.
